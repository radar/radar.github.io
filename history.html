<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Feb '21 -> Ongoing &mdash; Freelance contractor</h3>

<p>
  Working as a "gun for hire" across a variety of tech stacks, but primarily focussing on React + Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<p>
  My contracts at the moment are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>3-days-a-week as a Rails / JavaScript developer at a small company, primarily focussed on feature development and bug fixing. I'm also helping with things around making the platform more stable (by adding additional tests) and suggesting process improvements when I see them.</li>
  <li>2-days-a-week upgrading a Ruby on Rails application from Rails 5.0 to 6.1, and tidying up other deprecation messages / warnings in the build logs.
</ul>

<h3>December '20 -> Feb '21 &mdash; Seachange + beach holiday</h3>

<p class="large">Largely an operational role: moving an entire household from Melbourne to Warrnambool. Spent a lot of time on the beach.</p>

<h3>
  May '20 &rarr; December '20 &mdash;
  <a href="https://covidence.org">Covidence</a>
</h3>

<p class="large">Covidence provides workflow tooling that assists researchers with their systematic reviews.</p>


<p class="large">
  My role at Covidence was as a senior full-stack developer, leading efforts across the codebase ranging from compiling
  a design system in React, CSS & TypeScript, to working with legacy code in a Ruby on Rails application.
</p>

<p>
  I worked on a re-work of one of Covidence's major features called "Extraction", and was part of the team that launched
  (and maintained) Extraction 2.0.

<h3>
  December '19 &rarr; April '20 &mdash;
  <a href="http://coderacademy.edu.au">Coder Academy</a>
</h3>

<p class="large">
  <a href="http://coderacademy.edu.au">Coder Academy</a> runs bootcamps for first-time developers, with the aim of
  getting them into their first ever developer job.
</p>

<p class="large">
  At Coder Academy I was the Lead Educator for the Code Like a Girl cohort. I was training a group of 14 junior-junior
  developers in Ruby on Rails.
</p>

<p>
  Alongside this work, I was also working in a small team to improve the curriculum for Coder Academy across all of
  their campuses and bootcamps, focussing primarily on Computer Science Fundamentals, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript
  curriculum.

<h3>
  August '16 &rarr; November '19 &mdash;
  <a href="http://cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a>
</h3>

<p class="large">
  <a href="http://cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a> aims to improve the culture of
  companies around the world.
</p>

<p class="large">
  From August 2017 until November 2019, I was the Junior Engineering Program Lead at Culture Amp.
  This job involved recruiting and mentoring junior engineers in Ruby and
  JavaScript (and lots more!) with the goal of training them up to be the next
  great engineers at Culture Amp and in the wider developer community.
</p>

<p class="large">
  My work at Culture Amp prior to being the JEP Lead, involved working as a
  Senior Developer with a small (~5-8 people) team of developers to maintain our
  large Rails monolith and to write event-sourced microservices in Elixir, along
  with frontends in React, and associated tech.
</p>

<p>
  I loved working at Culture Amp because I got to do what I love: mentor and grow
  junior developers. I also get lots of opportunities to help out other
  developers by working with them on difficult issues.
</p>

<h3>December '08 &rarr; Current &mdash; Tech Book Author</h3>

<p class="large">
  I have contributed extensively to documentation for Ruby and Rails. I started
  writing documentation for Rails in December 2008. The two guides I am best
  known for are the
  <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a>
  and
  <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying guide</a>. I also wrote the
  <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Engines guide</a> and the
  <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Asset Pipeline guide</a>.
</p>

<p class="large">
  During 2010, I was contacted by <a href="https://manning.com">Manning</a> to
  write a book for them called
  <a href="manning.com/books/rails-3-in-action">Rails 3 in Action</a>. This
  subsequently went on to produce a second edition, called
  <a href="https://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 4 in Action</a>.
</p>

<p class="large">
  After the success of
  <a href="http://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 3 and Rails 4 in Action</a>
  I decided to strike out on my own and become a self-published author. I do
  this through <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> and have published two
  books (<a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2">Multitenancy with Rails</a>
  and <a href="https://leanpub.com/toyrobot">Toy Robot</a>) and I'm currently
  writing a third (<a href="https://leanpub.com/joyofelixir">Joy of Elixir</a>)
  and fourth (<a href="https://leanpub.com/elixir-toyrobot">The Toy Robot: The Elixir Version</a>).
</p>

<p>
  You can read more about these books over on
  <a href="/books">my books page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  As a part of this writing process, I developed
  <a href="https://github.com/radar/twist-v2">a review tool called "Twist"</a>
  which allows reviewers to leave notes on my books as they read them. It has
  been extremely useful.
</p>

<h3>
  January '15 &rarr; August '16 &mdash;
  <a href="http://marketplacer.com">Marketplacer</a>
</h3>

<p class="large">
  I worked at <a href="http://marketplacer.com">Marketplacer</a> as a Senior
  Developer. Marketplacer is an application which powers sites such as
  <a href="https://www.bikeexchange.com.au">BikeExchange</a> (also in the
  <a href="https://www.bikeexchange.com.au">US</a> and a few countries in
  Europe), <a href="https://www.tinitrader.com.au">TiniTrader</a> and
  <a href="https://www.bikeexchange.com">BikeExchange</a>. The overall goal of
  the application is to make it easier for stores and private sellers to sell
  their goods online.
</p>

<p>
  My day-to-day work involved working on new features for the Marketplacer
  application, and leading the Core development team. It was here that I was
  first introduced to Angular and React and where I learned I had a strong
  preference for React over Angular.
</p>

<h3>July '14 &rarr; Jan '15 &mdash; <a href="http://lifx.co">LIFX</a></h3>

<p class="large">
  At LIFX I worked on a small team of 3 developers building their Cloud
  architecture using a mixture of Ruby and Go. I wrote core parts of their API
  in Ruby, as well as a message broker that communicated between the Ruby API
  and LIFX lights located all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  This architecture allows users of LIFX lights to control their lights wherever
  they are in the world; and also provides integration with Nest. For example,
  if there's smoke detected in the house by a Nest smoke dectector, the LIFX
  lights will flash red.

<h3>
  November '11 &rarr; July '14 &mdash;
  <a href="http://spreecommerce.com">Spree Commerce</a>
</h3>

<p class="large">
  I was hired as the Community Manager for Spree after showing a very keen
  interest in the framework. I posted a lot to the user group and then one day
  Sean Schofield (the CEO of Spree) asked if I wanted a job which was
  essentially being paid to maintain open source. I said yes.
</p>

<p>
  At Spree I was _the_ Community Manager. This is a fancy title which means my
  primary responsibility was keeping the community happy. I did this by leading
  the development of the
  <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree">Spree ecommerce framework,</a>
  answering posts on our user group, writing documentation and giving talks all
  over the world about Spree. In one instance, I was flown to London to consult
  with a large surf clothing distributor.
</p>

<h3>2005 &rarr; 2011 &mdash; Various</h3>

<p class="large">
  My formative years. Spent this time working for various companies and
  freelancing, doing whatever PHP or Ruby on Rails work came my way.
