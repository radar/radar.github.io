    First and foremost: I'm a husband to Sharon and a dad to Ella. Being
    a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing. Ella is now making friends through
    daycare and she's sharing her energetic personality with people other than her close family.

    My family has made the move to a regional city last month -- <a
      href='https://goo.gl/maps/KLixwMUCxPqwZo1m8'>Warrnambool</a>, to be precise. It's a lovely change of pace from
    Melbourne and I'm enjoying the distinct lack of both traffic and distances between things.

  <h3>Work</h3>

  <p>
    I'm doing some contracting work for the first half of this year, working across things like Rails, TypeScript, React
    and Elixir.

  <h3>Writing</h3>

  <p>
    In my spare time, I'm continuing to write
    <a href="https://joyofelixir.com">Joy of Elixir</a>. This book is a gentle
    introduction to programming for first-timers, teaching them the ways of
    Elixir. Why I'm writing it is best explained by it
