    <h1>Hi! I'm Ryan!</h1>

    <p>I pay the bills through consultancy work, developing people (and apps!) in exchange for money. I
      then take what I learn from doing this, and write <a href="/books">books</a> to share that knowledge with other
      developers.</p>

    <p>
      If you want to contact me about working together, <a href="/work">you'll want to read this first.</a>
    </p>

    If you're interested, you can <a href="/now">see what I'm doing now.</a>
    </p>

    I write <a href='/blog'>some interesting posts</a> from time-to-time.
    </p>
