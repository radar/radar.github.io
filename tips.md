# Tips

Little tips that I've collected throughout my journey.

* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Fuzzy finder that can be used to search through your past command-line history, or to find a file. Does a bunch more, but that's the two things I use it for the most.
* [dot-files](https://github.com/radar/dot-files) - Helpful aliases and whatnots for shortcutting a bunch of common terminal interactions.
* [How to: target RSpec tests]({% link tips/target-rspec-tests.md %})
* [React-select Capybara helpers]({% link tips/react-select-capybara-helpers.md %}) - Directions for how to interact with React-select components from within Capybara tests.
* [React-select with use-debounce](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/radar/react-select-debounce/) - Make react-select wait a little bit before resolving results.
