            <p>After finishing my contract with SeaLink on the 25th January, I took a two week break from doing anything Ruby on Rails and then jumped straight back into it. I’ve recently tied up my loose end with JustComputing and they’re happy enough that I’m done with their system that they gave me 4 x 500GB harddrives. I’m now doing some contract work for SA Window Cleaning and I’m hoping that I’ll be done in about a month. After that, Dad wants me to do a job for him for his work (photocopier company) and I’ve still got offers from NetFox and CarbonPlanet, as well as Lama Chandrasena.</p>

<p>I appreciate everyone’s interest in wanting me to do work for them, but unfortunately I’m tied down for the next couple of months at least, which is a good thing. I’d love to work for NetFox, as that was the first thing to gain my interest when I went to the first Ruby Users group back in May last year, but I wanted a break from anything networking (after doing a couple of years of it at TAFE), so I went for SeaLink and that was a blast!</p>

<p>NetFox still has me interested and I’ll probably go for that after these couple of other jobs are done.</p>

<p>Thanks again to the people who have asked me if I want to work for them. I hope to talk with you all at the Ruby Users Group meeting next Tuesday!</p>
