    <h2>My Ideal Role</h2>

    <p>
      I <em>loved</em> mentoring junior developers at Coder Academy and at Culture Amp. What mattered to
      me here is that I felt like I was making a difference in developers' lives,
      and I was consistently supported in whatever I wanted to accomplish. This is
      my happy place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working on a team where I could mentor and grow the developers around me while we build applications is <em>my
        zone</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (Or if someone was to pay me to mentor juniors <em>and</em> write books
      full-time then I'd be up for that too!) But that's probably edging on wishful thinking!
    </p>

    <h4>FAQ</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Q: Would you like to relocate to [insert destination here]?</strong>
      No. I want to stay here in Warrnambool, Australia and continue to work from this
      great city. I am not interested in relocating at the moment. Commuting to Melbourne is out of the question too --
      it's
      a 4hr trip one way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Q: We do onboarding for [a number] of weeks in our [remote] office. Would
        that be okay with you?</strong>
      No. See above.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Q: Would you like to work with our team that is US-remote only? You would
        be our first remote hire.</strong>
      I'd prefer not to at this stage. I did this previously and found the feedback
      loop really long. I would prefer to keep working with companies that have an
      AU presence, even if that's just a team of developers instead of a full
      office.

  <h2>History</h2>

  <h3>Feb '21 -> Ongoing &mdash; Freelance contractor</h3>

  <p>
    Working as a "mercenary for hire" across a variety of tech stacks, but primarily focussing on Typescript-based React with Ruby on Rails.
  </p>

  <h3>December '08 &rarr; Current &mdash; Tech Book Author</h3>

  <p class="large">
    I have contributed extensively to documentation for Ruby and Rails. I started
    writing documentation for Rails in December 2008. The two guides I am best
    known for are the
    <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a>
    and
    <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying guide</a>. I also wrote
    the
    <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Engines guide</a> and the
    <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Asset Pipeline guide</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="large">
    During 2010, I was contacted by <a href="https://manning.com">Manning</a> to
    write a book for them called
    <a href="manning.com/books/rails-3-in-action">Rails 3 in Action</a>. This
    subsequently went on to produce a second edition, called
    <a href="https://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 4 in Action</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="large">
    After the success of
    <a href="http://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 3 and Rails 4 in Action</a>
    I decided to strike out on my own and become a self-published author. I do
    this through <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> and have published four
    books (<a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2">Multitenancy with Rails</a>
    and <a href="https://leanpub.com/toyrobot">Toy Robot</a>), <a href="https://leanpub.com/elixir-toyrobot">The Toy Robot: The Elixir Version</a>, and <a href='https://leanpub.com/rails'>Active Rails</a>. I'm currently
    writing a fifth book called <a href="https://leanpub.com/joyofelixir">Joy of Elixir</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can read more about these books over on
    <a href="/books">my books page</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a part of this writing process, I developed
    <a href="https://github.com/radar/twist-v2">a review tool called "Twist"</a>
    which allows reviewers to leave notes on my books as they read them. It has
    been extremely useful.

    My role at Covidence was as a senior full-stack developer, leading efforts across the codebase ranging from
    compiling
    a design system in React, CSS & TypeScript, to working with legacy code in a Ruby on Rails application.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked on a re-work of one of Covidence's major features called "Extraction", and was part of the team that
    launched
    (and maintained) Extraction 2.0.

    At Coder Academy I was the Lead Educator for the Code Like a Girl cohort. I was training a group of 14
    junior-junior
    developers in Ruby on Rails. I was then made redundant in this role due to the impact of COVID.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside this work, I was also working in a small team to improve the curriculum for Coder Academy across all of
    their campuses and bootcamps, focussing primarily on Computer Science Fundamentals, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript
    curriculum.

  <p class="large">
    <a href="http://cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a> aims to improve the culture of
    companies around the world.
  </p>

  <p class="large">
    From August 2017 until November 2019, I was the Junior Engineering Program Lead at Culture Amp.
    This job involved recruiting and mentoring junior engineers in Ruby and
    JavaScript (and lots more!) with the goal of training them up to be the next
    great engineers at Culture Amp and in the wider developer community.
  </p>

  <p class="large">
    My work at Culture Amp prior to being the JEP Lead, involved working as a
    Senior Developer with a small (~5-8 people) team of developers to maintain our
    large Rails monolith and to write event-sourced microservices in Elixir, along
    with frontends in React, and associated tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    The role of Junior Engineering Program lead was made redundant at the end of 2019 and I chose to take a redundancy
    payout rather than continue in a different role.
  </p>

  <p>
    I loved working at Culture Amp because I got to do what I love: mentor and grow
    junior developers. I also get lots of opportunities to help out other
    developers by working with them on difficult issues.

  <p class="large">
    I worked at <a href="http://marketplacer.com">Marketplacer</a> as a Senior
    Developer. Marketplacer is an application which powers sites such as
    <a href="https://www.bikeexchange.com.au">BikeExchange</a> (also in the

    the application is to make it easier for stores and private sellers to sell
    their goods online.
  </p>

  <p>
    My day-to-day work involved working on new features for the Marketplacer
    application, and leading the Core development team. It was here that I was
    first introduced to Angular and React and where I learned I had a strong
    preference for React over Angular.

  <h3>July '14 &rarr; Jan '15 &mdash; <a href="http://lifx.co">LIFX</a></h3>

  <p class="large">
    At LIFX I worked on a small team of 3 developers building their Cloud
    architecture using a mixture of Ruby and Go. I wrote core parts of their API
    in Ruby, as well as a message broker that communicated between the Ruby API
    and LIFX lights located all over the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    This architecture allows users of LIFX lights to control their lights wherever
    they are in the world; and also provides integration with Nest. For example,
    if there's smoke detected in the house by a Nest smoke dectector, the LIFX
    lights will flash red.

  <p class="large">
    I was hired as the Community Manager for Spree after showing a very keen
    interest in the framework. I posted a lot to the user group and then one day
    Sean Schofield (the CEO of Spree) asked if I wanted a job which was
    essentially being paid to maintain open source. I said yes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Spree I was _the_ Community Manager. This is a fancy title which means my
    primary responsibility was keeping the community happy. I did this by leading
    the development of the
    <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree">Spree ecommerce framework,</a>
    answering posts on our user group, writing documentation and giving talks all
    over the world about Spree. In one instance, I was flown to London to consult
    with a large surf clothing distributor.
